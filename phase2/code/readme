I have completed the whole project 2. All the features required in the project are working well.

Files that are included in this .tar file are used for project 2 phase 3.  If you want to test 'simos.exe', you should go to the submitted .tar file for phase1&2.

Commands to run the program:
make
./admin.exe 1000000   //after this, you can run any command provided in simos, such as 'q', 'e', 't', etc.
s                   // submit
prog1               // program, provided by the professor
s                   // submit
prog_phase2         // program, created from phase 2(Calculate the average)
T                   // quit the program
cat terminal.out    // check the output

I did not change any source code.
