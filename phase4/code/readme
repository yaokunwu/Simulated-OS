I have completed all the four phases in project 3.

Commands to run the program:

1. make             //to generate admin.exe and client.exe
2. mkdir clientDir       //make a folder to contain client side files
3. mv client.c client.exe prog1 prog1.err prog2.err clientDir   // separate client files from server side

/* run in server side window */
4. ./admin.exe 1000000 11941   

/* run in client side window (pwd is clientDir) */
5. ./client.exe 10.176.92.14 11941
6. s                   // submit
7. prog1               // normal program
8. s                   // submit
9. prog1.err           // program has loading problem
10. s                   // submit
11. prog2.err           // program has execution problem
12. T                   // quit client program

/* run in server side window */
13. T                   // quit server program   


Other than the files required to change,
1. I added FILE *clientF to PCB because term.c needs the info to send the output back to client
2. I modified the signiture of the submit_process() in process.c because I need to pass the FILE pointer to it
3. I added start_submit(int portno) and end_submit() functions to system.c to create and terminate the submit thread.
4. I added a global FILE *problemF because I need term.c to know where to send back the output of a given file when it has loading problem. (Since in this case, new PCB can not be successfully created, and the term.c need to send backthe response anyway).
