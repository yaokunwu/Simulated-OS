phase 1:
1. finished "cpu.c"
2. finished "process.c"
3. removed originally provided "simos.exe", "cpu.o", "process.o"
4. made a change to the "makefile" to use "paging.o" to compile

phase 2:
wrote a program called "prog_phase2", which calculates the average of four numbers and prints to terminal.out, with some sleep instructions in between to test


You can run simply use 1.make 2. ./simos.exe to run the program
