I have completed both phase1 and phase2 of project 3.

Phase1: Modification on "term.c".
Phase2: Modification on "process.c".

The makefile(modified) now compile to "simos.exe" with the new "term.c" and "process.c".

You can simply test the program by:
make
./simos.exe
s
prog1
y
50
T
cat terminal.out
